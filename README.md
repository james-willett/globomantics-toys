# Globomantics Toys API

This is a simple fictional API created to support my [Karate Fundamentals](https://pluralsight.com) course on Pluralsight.

## Running the application

To run the application through Spring Boot do  `mvn spring-boot:run`.

- When the application is running, documentation for the REST APIs is accessible at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.
